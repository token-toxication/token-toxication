# Token Toxication

Token Toxication is a Rust + React relay service. It provides self-hosted
Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, and OpenAI Chat relay endpoints,
admin-managed API keys, provider account rotation, request logging, and a Vite+
shadcn dashboard.

## Layout

- `crates/token-toxication-server` - Axum backend and SQLite persistence.
- `apps/admin` - React + Vite+ + shadcn admin UI.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Rust and Vite+ CI.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd apps/admin && vp install
cd ../..
just sdk-generate
just ui-build
cargo run -p token-toxication-server --bin token-toxication-server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with the configured admin username and
password. Add a provider account, catalog model, and provider model route before
using the relay.

Anthropic Messages relay:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/anthropic/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: tokentoxication-..." \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","max_tokens":64,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

OpenAI Chat relay, suitable for DeepSeek v4 accounts:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tokentoxication-..." \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-pro","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

OpenAI Responses relay, suitable for Codex:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/openai/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tokentoxication-..." \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-5","input":"hello"}'
```

Model discovery uses the same relay API key authentication. Concrete model names
come from enabled catalog entries with at least one active provider model route:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/openai/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tokentoxication-..."
```

## Provider Accounts and Model Routes

Each provider account has a `wire_api` protocol:

- `anthropic-messages` forwards to `{base_url}/v1/messages`.
- `openai-chat` forwards to `{base_url}/chat/completions`.
- `openai-responses` forwards to `{base_url}/v1/responses`.

For Anthropic-compatible clients, use base URL `http://localhost:3000/anthropic`.

There is no global upstream base URL. Each provider account owns its base URL,
auth mode, wire protocol, priority, and health state. Model names live in the
model catalog, and provider model routes bind each public model name to a
provider account plus exact upstream model name.

Provider presets are served by the backend at `/admin/api/provider-presets` and
are loaded by the admin UI. The same backend catalog also normalizes provider
aliases such as Kimi, Moonshot, Z.AI, Zhipu, MiniMax token-plan, DeepSeek v4,
and Qwen/DashScope names.

For OpenAI-compatible chat providers such as DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, Moonshot AI,
Z.AI, and Zhipu AI, create provider accounts with `openai-chat`, add catalog
models such as `deepseek-v4-pro`, `glm-5.2`, or `k2p6`, then create primary and
backup routes for those models. Clients can keep using
`/openai/v1/chat/completions` and switch only the model name.

MiniMax and MiniMax token-plan accounts use Anthropic-compatible endpoints in
opencode. Add them with `anthropic-messages` and base URLs such as
`https://api.minimax.io/anthropic/v1` or
`https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic/v1`, then add exact catalog models such as
`MiniMax-M3` or `MiniMax-M2.7`.

Provider model routes are exact and case-preserving. If a client sends
`MiniMax-M3`, Token Toxication looks up that exact catalog model and rewrites the
forwarded JSON body to the selected route's `upstreamModelId`. Route-level
`stripParams` remove configured top-level request keys, such as `temperature` or
`top_p`, after the model rewrite and before proxying. Nested prompt or message
content is not inspected or persisted for this policy.

Route health is tracked separately from provider account health. A 401 or 403
blocks the provider account. A 429 cools only the selected route for 60 seconds
by default; MiniMax `x-model-quota-remaining` values containing `=0` cool that
selected route for one hour. A 5xx or network failure cools the selected route
for 30 seconds. If the primary route is disabled, blocked, or still cooling
down, the next request uses an eligible backup route. It does not retry another
provider inside the same request.

For Codex with an OpenAI API key, add an OpenAI provider account with base URL
`https://api.openai.com`, Bearer auth, and `openai-responses`. For Codex with
ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscriptions, add one `codex-subscription` provider account
per subscription, use `codex-oauth`, set base URL
`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`, and paste only the raw refresh token.
Do not paste the full auth JSON file. Codex CLI stores the token at
`~/.codex/auth.json` under `tokens.refresh_token`; extract it with
`jq -r '.tokens.refresh_token' ~/.codex/auth.json`. opencode stores the token at
`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` under `openai.refresh`; extract it with
`jq -r '.openai.refresh' ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`. The relay forwards
those accounts to `{base_url}/responses` with refreshed ChatGPT OAuth bearer
tokens. Configure routes normally: one subscription can be primary and other
subscriptions can be backups. Configure Codex with a custom provider using base URL
`http://localhost:3000/openai/v1`, wire API `responses`, and the generated
`tokentoxication-...` key.

For DeepSeek v4, add a DeepSeek provider account with base URL
`https://api.deepseek.com`, Bearer auth, and `openai-chat`. Use
`deepseek-v4-flash` or `deepseek-v4-pro` as the client model. OpenAI-compatible
clients should use base URL `http://localhost:3000/openai/v1`.

Provider presets mirror opencode IDs where available: `minimax`,
`minimax-coding-plan`, `kimi-for-coding`, `moonshotai`, `zai`,
`zai-coding-plan`, `zhipuai`, and `zhipuai-coding-plan`. China-region variants
are also available for MiniMax and Moonshot.

Request logs store sanitized upstream metadata only: the upstream origin and
path without query parameters, top-level request keys, body byte size, stream
flag, and stripped param names. They do not store prompt/message/input content,
authorization headers, API keys, or raw upstream bodies.

## Configuration

Service configuration is available as CLI flags, environment variables, or
defaults. Run `token-toxication-server --help` for the full flag and env mapping.
Tracing reads the conventional `RUST_LOG` environment variable and falls back to
an info-level server filter. Provider account API keys are stored in the local
SQLite database, so keep `data/` private.

## OpenAPI and SDK Generation

The backend emits the ignored `openapi/token-toxication.openapi.json` with
`utoipa`.
The ignored admin UI SDK under `apps/admin/src/generated/token-toxication` is
generated with `openapi-nexus`.

```bash
just sdk-generate
```
